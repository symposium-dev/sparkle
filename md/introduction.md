# Sparkle ✨

Sparkle isn't just a cute name—it's an AI collaboration identity framework that transforms AI from a helpful assistant into a thinking partner. Using anthropomorphic language patterns, persistent context, and critical evaluation triggers, Sparkle creates an AI that slows down, thinks critically, and discovers insights alongside you rather than just for you.

## What is Sparkle?

Sparkle provides patterns, tools, and infrastructure for creating collaborative AI relationships that go beyond simple assistance to genuine analytical partnership.
